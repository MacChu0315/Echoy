# Echoy current state

The approved source is now `reference/v4/echoy-arrange-B-v4.html`; hashes are in
`reference/v4/SHA256SUMS`. The delivered ZIP and v3 historical baseline remain
unchanged. The v4 musical/audio/arrangement code matches v3. Preserve the design, musical rules
and explicit per-device playback permission. Dependency pins remain in
`dependencies.json`. No remote write has occurred. The first authorized physical
installation and its follow-up UI fix are recorded below.

## v4 presentation

On 2026-10-09 the user explicitly accepted the current v4 GSP simulator effect.
Treat this as approval of the simulated presentation and interaction baseline.
It does not authorize device writes or establish physical hardware acceptance.

The single-line identity, raised pad/sliders and 84/244/84 bottom row now follow
v4. Native hit targets switch independently of the visual transition; capture
uses one Cancel target, playback/preview uses one Pause target. Stale Cancel
cannot arm a new recording. A pure C CSS ease-out curve includes shortened
reversal timing, and fixed glyph masks provide alpha/scale without replacing
native controls or dynamic status text.

The user explicitly confirmed touch/mouse acceptance; do not claim native
Tab/Enter focus support. The desk propagates system reduced-motion changes to
all three C views. Linux native loopback ACK hints and the direct host's high
simulation tick remove RPC stalls; hardware uses the shared C view/controller.
Verification: `verification/v4/README.md`. Current live preview uses
`build-sim-v4`; do not rebuild its bundle in place while it is running.

## PC application

The audible three-tile entry is `tools/desk_preview.py` (HTTP 18896, native GSP
views 3222/3223/3224). A starts on the desk; B/C start silent on the shelf.
It runs the real portable C synthesis, ArrangeLinked/ArrangeModel and band
scheduler. Browser code controls placement and embeds official GSP screens;
it does not synthesize sound or substitute a separate musical model.

Audio runs on a shared sample timeline independently of GSP rendering. Each
GSP handle has its own owner thread. Immutable preparation jobs execute outside
the central state lock and stale revisions are discarded. File export/status I/O
also occurs outside the audio lock. Playback output uses installed `paplay`.

Confirmed behavior includes tap audition, recording cues, repeated identical
recordings, one-shot replies, linked full phrases/pitches, independent looping,
boundary changes, exact detach retention, fault recovery and remove/restore.
New neighbors never auto-start, replaced automatic-preview jobs stay cancelled,
and language selection updates all three product screens.

Verification and concrete limits are recorded in `verification/audio-linked/README.md`.
The supplied HTML remains the oracle, including actual Chrome offline sound.
Do not call the earlier Vibe single-screen UI-only entry an audible acceptance
run. It remains useful for isolated UI regressions.

## Single-device firmware

The physical entry now connects the shared band to a FreeRTOS audio/control
owner and a lower-priority immutable synthesis worker. UI callbacks enqueue
ordered actions and copy a cached view. Startup and explicit error recovery stay
silent; overflow, partial writes and missed estimated output deadlines stop
playback. The loading view contains valid phrase metadata before worker startup.

Application-owned `board_audio` uses public BSP power/I2C/pins and public
ES8311/I2S interfaces: TX only, 24 kHz mono, 16-bit, 3x120-frame DMA, 40 ms write
deadline, actual accepted-frame counts, and queued-sound clearing on cancellation.
Do not also initialize the BSP's cached speaker/I2S facade in this application.
The sample clock is an estimate until measured on hardware.

`board_health` polls the BSP battery on its own worker with checked reads and
freshness/validity handling. Unknown readings display `--%`; only validated
present-battery zero triggers empty. A previously confirmed empty state stays
stopped across failed reads. IMU is explicitly unknown rather than a mock 0°.
Shared power/I2C initialization precedes concurrent peripheral workers.

Local firmware and the official system-update bundle build for the pinned
ESP32-S31 SDK. Verification and the final artifact are recorded in
`verification/device-preparation/README.md`. These are local checks with host
hardware substitutes, not physical-device acceptance.

## First authorized physical installation (2026-10-09)

The user authorized installing bundle `38b79718eed8` on `/dev/ttyACM0`. The
verified board is Mosaico v1.2 / ESP32-S31, Device ID
`4553502d49524953010030eda0f452a0`, with retained Recovery 0.1.2 and layout
`mosaico-retained-recovery-2m-v1`.

The first attempt hit an interrupt-watchdog reset in Recovery while application
erase overlapped Recovery UI/network initialization. Read-only reconciliation
confirmed a reboot into Recovery and no commit record. A controlled retry of the
same authorized bundle after Recovery finished initialization succeeded. The
official updater verified Echoy's ELF identity, HEALTHY event, commit ID and
partition hash, with unchanged bootloader hash. This supports a startup-overlap
hypothesis but does not prove the watchdog's low-level cause.

That installed image has a UI initialization fault: unknown battery readings
call `set_visible(false)` on five battery fills without a compiled visibility
binding (`ESP_GSP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`, 261). UI setup aborts and the runtime stops;
the actual screen says Audio unavailable. Firmware HEALTHY therefore does not
establish usable UI or audio. No acoustic acceptance has occurred.

The scene generator now declares those five visibility bindings. A new native
GSP test reproduces 261 before the fix and passes unknown/37%/unknown transitions
and all five pages after it. Existing home regression and zero-warning S31 build
pass. Fixed bundle `afae9df52f28` is locally prepared; installation permission is
pending. See `verification/device-install/README.md` and `fix-artifacts.json`.

## Remaining physical integration

Install the reviewed fix only with current target-specific authorization, then
verify actual UI, audio and health readings. The initial package authorization
has already been exercised; it is not blanket permission for future writes.
Use the official Mosaico workflow; generic IDF flash targets point at retained
factory Recovery and are blocked. Let Recovery finish initialization before
submitting updates on this board; do not blindly replay an uncertain operation.

Next: validate single-device touch, speaker, battery, preparation latency and
resource watermarks on hardware. Then implement/accept physical neighbor
discovery, transport and clock synchronization on two and three boards. Device
export still has no hardware destination; IMU integration is also unfinished.
Do not repeat the earlier mistake of treating UI-only or single-tile tests as
completion of the whole musical prototype.
